# angular-token-auth

## Summary:
This is a walkthrough for building an angular front-end for an express app that uses json web tokens for auth. The app is heavily influenced by Michael Herman's tutorial: http://mherman.org/blog/2017/01/05/token-based-authentication-with-angular/#.We-eA2SnEWo

The tutorial for the node/express app is here: https://github.com/Jufebrown/sequelize-token-auth

If you want to clone and run the code in this repo, you will need to run ```npm i``` to install the dependencies.
